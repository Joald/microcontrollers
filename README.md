# microcontrollers
Collection of programs created during the Microcontrollers class

## Structure
- `lib/`: contains utility code, which will most likely be useful in multiple tasks
- `communicator/`: An attempt at creating a program for communicating with a device through USB (via UART). Doesn't work at all yet.
- `labtest/`: An attempt at compiling the program with CMake in order to use CLion with it. Only compiles to ELF as of yet.
- `leds_main/`: Task 0
- `uart/`: Task 1
- `Makefile.sample`: sample Makefile to copy to new projects
- `godbolt-compiler-setup.txt`: short info on how to setup Compiler Explorer to generate code which (at least partially) resembles the code generated for the microcontroller.
